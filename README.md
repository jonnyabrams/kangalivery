# Kangalivery

A Deliveroo clone using React Native. Users can select dishes from featured restaurants, then be taken to a basket which calculates the total to be paid.

Upon placing the order, the app brings up a modal displaying an animation which navigates to a delivery confirmation screen after four seconds.

Alas, no actual food is delivered.
